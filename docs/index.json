The recent progress in the control of artificial quantum systems already allows for studying Abelian lattice gauge theories in table-top experiments. However, the realization of non-Abelian models remains challenging. Here, we employ a coherent quantum control scheme to enforce non-Abelian gauge invariance, and discuss this idea in detail for a one dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge system. Finally, we comment on how to extend our scheme to other non-Abelian gauge symmetries and higher spatial dimensions, which summarized, provides a promising route for the quantum simulation of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.","tags":["quantum simulation","dynamical gauge fields","non-abelian","kip"],"title":"Non-Abelian gauge invariance from dynamical decoupling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lilo Höcker","Rohit Prasad Bhatt","Jan Kilinc","Fred Jendrzejewski"],"categories":"Poster","content":"","date":1606089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609340687,"objectID":"a51f8286da64d55e394cdff766f6a7f4","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/talk/2020-lilo-qtd/","publishdate":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-lilo-qtd/","section":"talk","summary":"We present our progress in the construction of a new experimental apparatus for the study of quantum thermodynamics.","tags":["Poster"],"title":"A new Na-K apparatus to study quantum thermodynamics","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Apoorva Hegde","Alexander Mil","Torsten Zache","Andy Xia","Rohit Prasad Bhatt","Markus Oberthaler","Philipp Hauke","Jürgen Berges","Fred Jendrzejewski"],"categories":"Poster","content":"","date":1605484800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609340687,"objectID":"b88dd3382c1423adaba5f00f58ff2524","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/talk/2020-hegde-coolme/","publishdate":"2020-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-hegde-coolme/","section":"talk","summary":"We discuss our experimental progress on the implementation of local U(1) symmetries in cold atomic mixtures.","tags":["Poster"],"title":"Quantum simulation of dynamical gauge fields using ultracold atomic mixtures","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Valentin Kasper","Daniel González-Cuadra","Apoorva Hegde","Andy Xia","Alexandre Dauphin","Felix Huber","Eberhard Tiemann","Maciej Lewenstein","Fred Jendrzejewski","Philipp Hauke"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1603929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609848086,"objectID":"eb39353ee37685be1311754e6b5f4c3f","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/kasper-2020/","publishdate":"2020-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kasper-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantum information platforms made great progress in the control of many-body entanglement and the implementation of quantum error correction, but it remains a challenge to realize both in the same setup.

Lattice gauge theories are a particular important class of quantum systems with an extensive number of local constraints and play a central role in high energy physics, condensed matter and quantum information. Whereas recent experimental progress points towards the feasibility of large-scale quantum simulation of Abelian gauge theories, the quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories appears still elusive. In this paper we present minimal non-Abelian lattice gauge theories, whereby we introduce the necessary formalism in well-known Abelian gauge theories, such as the Jaynes-Cumming model. In particular, we show that certain minimal non-Abelian lattice gauge theories can be mapped to three or four level systems, for which the design of a quantum simulator is standard with current technologies. Further we give an upper bound for the Hilbert space dimension of a one dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory, and argue that the implementation with current digital quantum computer appears feasible.","tags":["Quantum Simulation","Lattice Gauge Theory"],"title":"From the Jaynes–Cummings model to non-abelian gauge theories: a guided tour for the quantum engineer.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fred Jendrzejewski","Apoorva Hegde","Rohit Prasad Bhatt"],"categories":null,"content":"This is a block seminar, which will be organized together with experts from IBM-Q, we will explore the possibilities of quantum hardware like cold atom machines and IBM-Q to solve a variety of problems.

This rise was fueled by activities of massive commercial players like IBM, Google, Microsoft and large investments in startups like D-Wave, Rigetti, Xanadu, Zapata and Cambridge Quantum Computing. The work of these companies typically focuses on universal quantum computers, which hold the premise of exponential speed-up for a variety of NP-hard problems. However, this universality usually comes at the price of algorithmic overhead for a wide range of tasks which generally leads to worse overall fidelity. If we give up the constraint of a universal quantum computer, we can build specialized quantum hardware for the problems of interest. Such systems are called quantum simulators. Ultra-cold atoms have become a leading platform of such quantum simulators at a large scale. Most importantly for us, they are the experimental platform our research group is working on. Already demonstrated applications involve an enormous variety of condensed-matter problems like e.g. the Hubbard model (Citation: Bloch \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32; 2008) Bloch,\u0026#32; I.,\u0026#32; Dalibard,\u0026#32; J.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Zwerger,\u0026#32; W. \u0026#32; (2008). \u0026#32;Many-body physics with ultracold gases.

However, quantum simulators are currently limited to an academic environment because of   the complexity of constructing the experimental hardware, which involves substantial technical know-how and funding.\n  the specificity of knowledge and language required to understand/communicate the experiment.\n  the need to formulate the target problem as a Hamiltonian.\n  the manual compilation of programs on this hardware class.   A circuit-based approach to ultra-cold atom quantum simulators would alleviate points 2) and 3) as we could agree on the quantum circuit, given the hardware-specific operations, and run it on the experiment. Integrating the system with a software stack like PennyLane would additionally allow to address and run the experiment on a higher level and substantially lower the barrier of entry for users outside of the cold-atom and quantum physics community. These points motivated our research group to have a look how our experimental hardware, which is controlled by the Labscript Suite, can be integrated into PennyLane to run quantum circuits on ultra-cold atom devices. Our group is part of SynQS, working on two ultra-cold atom experiments, the NaLi and SoPa (named after the two atomic species used in the lab).\nWhy use ultra-cold atoms as a quantum information platform ? For ultra-cold atoms, the processing unit is not a qubit and as such, the natural operations are not generally the commonly used and widely known qubit operations such as $X,Y,Z$ rotations, Hadamard $H$ gates, entangling $CNOT$ or $XX$ gates with oberservables like $\\sigma^z$ expectations. Instead, our NaLi experiment implements a $X(\\theta)$ rotation on a long spin of many bosons on one optical lattice site. Additionally, the system naturally evolves under a many-body Hamiltonian $H_{mb}$, coupling the the atomic species.\nWhat is the qubit equivalent of those operations? The relation is pretty complex - and that is the nice thing! Cold atoms are different. Given their success in the quantum simulation of many-body problems, they could make for an exciting quantum information processor that is complementary to universal devices. So as a general rule of thumb, it could be argued that cold atom machines often give up some control over individual particles, leading to much bigger systems. Additionally, because we work with a large number of atoms, we can measure obtain rather precise estimates of expectation values with a single state preparation and one measurement. A concrete example from our group Before we go into more detailed discussion of our implementation, we will present a concrete example of our device, where we study lattice gauge theories. These theories have become a popular benchmark for quantum simulators (Citation: Kokail \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32; 2019) Kokail,\u0026#32; C.,\u0026#32; Maier,\u0026#32; C.,\u0026#32; Bijnen,\u0026#32; R.,\u0026#32; Brydges,\u0026#32; T.,\u0026#32; Joshi,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Jurcevic,\u0026#32; P.,\u0026#32; Muschik,\u0026#32; C.,\u0026#32; Silvi,\u0026#32; P.,\u0026#32; Blatt,\u0026#32; R.,\u0026#32; Roos,\u0026#32; C.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Zoller,\u0026#32; P. \u0026#32; (2019). \u0026#32;Self-verifying variational quantum simulation of lattice models.

On our NaLi machine, we recently performed experiments on the building block for certain quantum simulators that would be suited for theories from high-energy physics (Citation: Mil \u0026amp; al.)

Science,\u0026#32;367.\u0026#32;1128–1130. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz5312 . These experiments are performed with two atomic species, sodium and lithium, that can be prepared in two internal spin states. Re-thinking our analog quantum simulation for the purpose of quantum circuits, we can represent the sodium atoms as a very long spin state $\\left|\\psi_N\\right\\rangle$. The observable outcomes are $L_z=-\\frac{N}{2},\\cdots,\\frac{N}{2}$, where $N\\sim10^5$ is the number of sodium atoms. On a quantum computer this should be compared to a qubit, for which we can only measure two outcomes $L_z=\\pm\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe lithium atoms on the other hand can be described by the states on two independent sites $\\left|\\psi_p\\right\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_v\\rangle$. For each site we can observe that number of atoms that sit on it. The observable outcomes are then $n_{p/v} = 0, \\dots, n$ where $n\\sim 10^4$ is the number of lithium atoms. In this formulation and analogous to other circuit-based quantum computing devices, the NaLi experiment then consists of three main stages:\n  The atoms are prepared in some initial state\u0026hellip;\n  controlled through a set of operations/gates\u0026hellip;\n  and then measured to evaluate the operators $L_z$ and $N_{p,v}$\n  Without having to dig through all the physical details to understand the publication (Citation: Mil \u0026amp; al.)

We have our own experiment in the lab which implements a non-standard device for quantum simulation and thus some of our requirements are (roughly in order of importance):\n  Can we integrate our own experimental hardware into the framework and potentially run it from there?\n  How strong of an assumption is made about the computational unit of the hardware? Does it have to be strictly qubits/photons etc.?\n  Is the framework open-source and shows openness to the academic community?\n  Can also integrate classical simulators that are based on our hardware?\n  Does it provide some sort of user management and safety measures to avoid unqualified users from killing the system?\n  Lets give a brief overview of how we answered those questions with regard to PennyLane. PennyLane is designed for users to write and use their own plugin, which is what they call the integration of quantum computing devices into the framework. Officially, it only supports qubit and continuous variable devices and not more general approaches but we may be able to integrate bosonic and fermionic atoms flexibly as the code itself is not very restricted. Other big platorms like Qiskit, Forest and Strawberry Fields focus exclusively on their own quantum computing hardware or simulator without the possibility to integrate your own. PennyLane is open-source and Python-based, which is perfect as the Labscript Suite controlling our experiment is so, too. Additionally, the company behind PennyLane, Xanadu, is a partly academic player who is very open in their publications and supports a great community around the software. The framework allows to add simulators to the framework device which mirror the functionality of the hardware. It performs various parameter range checks for the system and the operations used. Not built-in is user a system for management which allows only registered users to run the experiment from a queue. We would have to implement this ourselves.\nAll-in-all, PennyLane seems to be the best and likely only fit for our endeavors. Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about it in more detail.\nPennylane  A cross-platform Python library for quantum machine learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.\n  PennyLane as the connecting puzzle piece.   PennyLane is created by Xanadu  and presents itself as the connecting puzzle piece between powerful established python libraries for machine learning, and quantum computing platforms. It provides readily implemented quantum algorithms for quantum machine learning, quantum chemistry and optimization. A particular algorithm provided in PennyLane is automatic differentiation of quantum circuits which allows to perform shot-efficient application of classical-quantum algorithms such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Existing popular quantum computing platforms such as Qiskit for qubits and Strawberry Fields (also created by Xanadu) for photons have written plugins for PennyLane which make their quantum simulators or quantum hardware accessible through it and with that PennyLane\u0026rsquo;s quantum algorithms and automatic differentiation feature. In fact, any quantum lab can adapt the plugin template for their own experiment and simulators to assimilate their own specific workflow with PennyLane where users are generally able to use the same workflow accross platforms and know what to expect. Fig. 3 below shows a typical way of using PennyLane in a classical-quantum hybrid algorithm. Here, the default qubit simulator by PennyLane is used. After writing our own plugin, we can call that device, change the quantum circuit to contain the supported operations and the workflow is otherwise the same. All-in-all, the interface is very robust towards changing up the quantum backend (especially when they support the same operations).\n Typical simple way of using PennyLane by instantiating the device, defining the parametrized quantum circuit and the cost, and calculating the gradient for the classical parameters.   Our workflow and connecting PennyLane to our hardware The current state of our pennylane_ls plugin for ultra-cold atom experiments can be viewed in this public github repository. It provides examples from our labs and can guide you to adapting it to your own experiment and needs.\nOur group uses the Labscript suite to coordinate and execute experimental sequences with cold atoms.   The labscript suite is a collection of programs, which work together to form a control system for autonomous, hardware timed experiments.  On the deepest level it is very nuts and bolts with plenty of commands in the style of Fig. 4 below.\n The Experiment.py (left) defines the experimental sequence of a Labscript-controlled lab experiment, here by calling functions from NaLiFunctions.py at given times. The function UMPUMP (right) shows the exact low level hardware instructions that are to be executed.   The Experiment.py file determines the exact sequence of hardware controls that is executed during the measurement. It contains Labscript syntax and is fed into the Labscript Python compiler Runmanager. Our approach for combining Labscript with PennyLane is sumarized in Fig. 5.\nWith the help of the plugin functions pre_apply(), apply() and post_apply(), we generate a new Experiment.py on the fly depending on the quantum circuit programmed through the PennyLane interface.\n The functions pre_apply(), apply() and post_apply() are used to generate a new Experiment.py on the fly for each quantum circuit in PennyLane. apply() loops through the operations in the circuit while the other functions always write the same necessary code for the compilation.   In other words, our PennyLane plugin translates a quantum circuit to an Experiment.py which our control system can interpret.\nThe expval() method from the plugin is then used to send the newly generated file to the Runmanager and engage the sequence. The output shots are then evaluated and the method returns an expectation.\nA detailled discussion of the technical details can be found in the README.md of the public repository. The features of our plugin currently include:\n  Proposing a higher-level control of experiments that are run controlled by the Labscript Suite through PennyLane.\n  A framework device that provides a template for labs with Labscript to quickly adapt code for their own setup.\n  Including two devices of the SynQS group at the Kirchhoff-Institute for Physics of Prof. Fred Jendrzejewski.\n  The framework device in SynQSDevice.py is written such that a group which uses the Labscript Suite to run their experiment can adapt the module easily to their own setup.\nFinishing up this project, we have succeed in providing first circuit control to our experiments through PennyLane and extract the results. However, much further automation will be needed to fully leverage the possibilities of the quantum circuits that we can run on our ultra-cold atom devices.\nFuture steps To get the project towards a full Pennylane plugin, we have to:\n  Give wires a meaning.\n  Operations need to be restricted to certain wires, especially when different atomic species are involved.\n  Implement true remote control of the lab through the pennylane_ls module.\n  Implement full result post-processing that is currently used in the lab.\n  Implement some kind of user management.\n  While it seems quite clear how we can implement points 1 - 4, it seems to be a whole new problem to implement some kind of user management for our systems. In any case the first steps are remarkably promising and we will see how the quantum circuits can be efficiently employed in ultra-cold atom experiments.\n","date":1590364800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609843797,"objectID":"bc6b7d038c1284e30e6cbb6f57910004","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/post/2020-atomic-quantum-circuits/","publishdate":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-atomic-quantum-circuits/","section":"post","summary":"In this blog-post, we present our path and thoughts towards using ultra-cold atom experiments for quantum computation.

Experimentally, the building block is realized by Bose-Einstein condensates of lithium and sodium condense d in a single optical dipole trap. Gauge and matter degrees of freedom are mapped in this system onto the internal states of the atomic species. The necessary U(1) gauge invariance is realized via heteronuclear spin changing collisions (SCC) between both species.\nThe building block represents an important stepstone towards quantum simulation of extended lattice gauge theories as, within the same setting, it features systematic protection of gauge invariance, a realistic approach of the continuum limit for gauge fields and the potential for scalability.\nUsing SCC, systematic protection of gauge invariance in the system is achieved by exploiting the inherent angular momentum conservation in the atomic mixture. The continuum limit of gauge fields is recovered in the framework of quantum link models by working with Bose-Einstein condensates with high atom numbers in the order of $10^5$. The building block can be scaled up to an extended U(1) lattice gauge theory by arranging individual building blocks on the sites of an optical lattice and connecting them via Raman-assisted tunneling.\nGreat tunability of our experimental building block is demonstrated by studying SCC dynamics as a function of various experimental parameters. We observe coherent SCC interactions between both species after an initialization quench. Furthermore, we recorded the SCC resonance as a function of this initialization quench and the offset magnetic field. We present a theoretical framework for the building block model based on a mean field theory with a phenomenological decoherence term. Within this framework the experimental SCC measurements are excellently described, identifying our experimental system as a faithful representation of the building block.\nOur results open up the possibility for extended lattice gauge theories based on multiple building blocks. These systems will allow for quantum simulation of gauge theories with the potential to address important questions in modern physics that can currently not be simulated by classical computational techniques.","tags":["Ultracold","Atomic mixture","Lithium","Sodium","lattice gauge theory","dynamical gauge fields"],"title":"Experimental realization of U(1) gauge invariance in ultracold atomic mixtures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Hesse","Kerim Köster","Jakob Steiner","Julia Michl","Vadim Vorobyov","Durga Dasari","Jörg Wrachtrup","Fred Jendrzejewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1584489600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609656932,"objectID":"8c5f7fc3f01a1aaa03efe97e18d768b5","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/hesse-2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hesse-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"In atomic physics experiments, magnetic fields allow to control the interactions between atoms, eg. near Feshbach resonances, or by employing spin changing collisions.

This allows us to measure and stabilize magnetic fields of 46.6 G down to 1.2 mG RMS noise, with the potential of reaching much higher field strengths. Because the magnetic field is measured directly, we reach minimum shot-to-shot fluctuations of 0.32(4) ppm on a 22 minute time interval, ensuring high reproducibility of experiments.

Three key characteristics which are crucial to the quantum Otto cycle are described: First, spatial movement of the lithium cloud is implemented by adjusting the relative phase of the two interfering beams up to $\\Delta \\theta = 3\\pi$. Second, the energy level spacing in the trap are adjustable by controlling the laser intensity. Third, the spatial overlap between clouds of sodium and lithium atoms can be optimized by an accordion setup with two electric tunable lenses which allows to change the periodicity of the standing-wave dynamically by a factor of two. Furthermore, the stability of the setup is characterized. An estimate on the trap storage time based on heating rates by spontaneous emission, intensity and trap center fluctuations is given. In the current setup, the storage time is limited by detuning and power of the laser. With a 5nm blue-detuned setup the estimated storage time is up to 4s, whereas intensity and trap center fluctuations would allow for a estimated lifetime of bigger than 80s. The longterm trap center stability was characterized and substantially improved by temperature stabilization of the electro-optical modulator crystal to approximately $0.3/\\pi = 12 h$. In the near future, this setup will be installed on the main experiment, allowing the sodium-lithium experiment to become a test-bed for quantum thermodynamics.","tags":["Ultracold","Atomic mixture","Lithium","Sodium","quantumthermo","Quantum thermodynamics","Accordion lattice"],"title":"Implementing an Optical Accordion Lattice for the Realization of a Quantized Otto Cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P Bienias","S Subhankar","Y Wang","T-c Tsui","Fred Jendrzejewski","T Tiecke","L Jiang","S L Rolston","J V Porto","A V Gorshkov"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1530921600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609310819,"objectID":"46d6c331523d8343e22780a13599718f","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/bienias-2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bienias-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"There has been a recent surge of interest and progress in creating subwavelength free-space optical potentials for ultracold atoms.

Future progress towards scalable quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories, however, hinges crucially on the efficient use of experimental resources. As we argue in this work, due to the fundamental non-uniqueness of discretizing the relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian, the lattice representation of gauge theories allows for an optimization that up to now has been left unexplored. We exemplify our discussion with lattice quantum electrodynamics in two-dimensional space-time, where we show that the formulation through Wilson fermions provides several advantages over the previously considered staggered fermions. Notably, it enables a strongly simplified optical lattice setup and it reduces the number of degrees of freedom required to simulate dynamical gauge fields. Exploiting the optimal representation, we propose an experiment based on a mixture of ultracold atoms trapped in a tilted optical lattice.

And we will walk through this control in the simple case of intensity control, which is a very straight-forward example, which allows us to understand the basics.\nTerminology and Basics This section closely follow ideas from (Citation: Bechhoefer,\u0026#32; 2005) Bechhoefer,\u0026#32; J. \u0026#32; (2005). \u0026#32;Feedback for physicists: A tutorial essay on control. Reviews of Modern Physics,\u0026#32;77(3).\u0026#32;783–836. https://doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.77.783  . A generic feedback control is seen in Fig. 1. A system $G(s)$ is being controlled with a control signal $r(s)$. The goal of the feedback is for the output of the system $y(s)$ to follow the control signal $r(s)$. The general idea is the following: measure the output of the system, determine its difference to the control voltage to get error $\\epsilon$ and use this error signal as input for some control law $K(s)$ that tries to minimize the error signal.\n Block diagram showing a generic feedback control. The system G(s) is controlled by the control law K(s).   Here we analyze the system in frequency space, where $s=i\\omega$. This is a convenient way to analyze control systems. An easy way to measure quantity of such a system is the closed-loop transfer function $T$:\n$$T= \\frac{y(s)}{r(s)} = \\frac{K(s)G(s)}{1+K(s)G(s)}$$\nFor system stability the loop-shape $H$ is important and can be determined from $T$: $$ H = K(s)G(s) = \\frac{T}{1-T} \\tag{1} \\label{1} $$ Why is it important ? As we see from (\\ref{1}), the system gets unstable if $KG= -1$. This means that a feedback system will get unstable if $|KG|=1$ with a simultaneous phase lag of 180°.\nWhereas it is good to have control over an output variable up to a certain frequency, we are in many cases also interested in noise suppression. For example, atoms in a dipole trap experience a heating rate proportional to intensity fluctuations at twice the trap frequency. Only by suppressing the laser intensity noise, you can assure long trap lifetimes and/or ground state atoms. For this reason we consider output disturbances $d(s)$ and sensor noise $\\xi (s)$ (see Fig. 2):\n$$ y(s) = \\frac{KG}{1+KG}[ r(s)-\\xi(s)] + \\frac{1}{1+KG}d(s) $$\nWhat does this mean? There are two things to learn from that. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the disturbances, and introduce the sensitivity, sometimes also called noise suppression: $$S = \\frac{1}{1+KG} = 1-T$$ We see that a servo with a high gain leads to a low sensitivity to outside disturbances. The trade-off is that the higher the gain, the noisier the output signal. The reason is that with detector noise the control signal effectively becomes $r(s)-\\xi(s)$, meaning that we cannot distinguish the control signal from measurement noise. Thus the higher the gain, the noisier the output.\n Same system as Fig. 1, but added disturbances d(s) and detector noise.   Another trade-off - which holds for almost all systems (to be exact: if KG has at least two more poles than zeros, and has no poles in the right half plane (is stable)) - is the following: $$\\int_0^\\infty ln|S(s)|ds =0$$ This is known as Bode\u0026rsquo;s sensitivity integral. It means that if you suppress the Sensitivity to disturbances in some frequency regime, you necessarily increase it in some other frequency regime (see Fig. 3 taken from (Citation: Stein,\u0026#32; 2003) Stein,\u0026#32; G. \u0026#32; (2003). \u0026#32;Respect the unstable. IEEE Control Systems Magazine,\u0026#32;23(4).\u0026#32;12–25. https://doi.org/10.1109/mcs.2003.1213600 ).\n If the Sensitivity to disturbances is suppressed in the low frequency regime, it is necessarily increased in some higher frequency regime.   Now before looking at the different systems $G(s)$, we have a look at the control law $K(s)$. The most-used controller is the PID-controller, or very often experimentally only a PI-controller. The P stands for proportional gain, the I for integral gain and the D for derivative gain. Which makes sense if we look at the response in time domain:\n$$u(t) = K_p\\epsilon(t) + K_i\\int \\epsilon(t) dt + K_D \\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt}$$\nIn frequency domain the same thing has the following form:\n$$K(s) = \\frac{u(s)}{\\epsilon(s)} = K_p + \\frac{K_i}{s} + K_Ds$$\nIntensity stabilization Overview For the control of the intensity, we typically have the set-up that is sketched in Fig. 4. The power of the AOM\u0026rsquo;s first order beam is dependent on the RF power: $\\epsilon_{1st order}\\approx\\sin^2(P_{RF}/P_{RF_{sat}})$. Therefore the power of the laser beam that leads to the experiment can be controlled by modulating the RF power.\n A photodiode gets a fraction of the first order AOM beam. The power of this beam can be modulated via RF amplitude modulation.   The System How to characterize the system without PI contol? (\u0026ldquo;system\u0026rdquo; refers to AOM+Driver+AOM+Photodiode) The tools needed for that are a function generator, oscilloscope and a network analyzer. All of that can be found in the RedPitaya controlled by PyRPL we use (see Fig. 5).\n This shows how to characetrize the system without PI-controller. The AOM Driver expects a signal from 0 to 1V to attenuate the RF signal accordingly. This again changes the 1st order beam power and therefore the voltage on the photodiode. The RedPitaya can supply the control voltage for the driver as well as measure the signal on the photodiode.   So what do we measure? As mentioned in the Introduction, we can measure the closed-loop transfer function $T$ and then calculate the open-loop transfer function $H$ to look for a desired loopshape.\nHow to change laser power by modulating RF power The whole intensity stabilization is based on being able to modulate the RF power that goes to the AOM. In our case, we have a home-build AOM driver that allows for this modulation with a control voltage ranging from 0 to 1V. Most drivers work with a Voltage Controlled Oscillator, a Mixer or Variable Voltage Attenuator to attenuate the RF power, and and an amplifier end-stage, because the AOM usually requires 30dBm, while the VCO outputs something much lower.\nTherefore the voltage on the photodiode depends on the control voltage at the AOM driver and the dependency is nonlinear (see figure 6).\n Relationship between control voltage and photodiode voltage. Not that the y-axis is basically arbitrary, as this depends on pick-off ratio and initial laser power.   Analysis in Frequency space with Bode plots The RedPitaya with its network analyzer module, allows us to characterize the setup in frequency space. In the figure above we saw how the Photodiode voltage (laser power) depends on the control voltage on the AOM driver when applying a DC or very low frequency signal. Now we modulate the VCO control voltage with the following: $U_{control}=0.6V+0.01V\\cdot\\sin\\left(2\\cdot\\pi\\cdot f\\cdot t\\right)$ Can the Photodiode follow this modulation up to arbitrary frequency? Probably not, but how can we measure this? The network analyzer can excite the system with above voltage $U_{control}$ and compare the amplitude of oscillation in the and $U_{Photodiode}$ to measure magnitude and phase. It does so by demodulating the photodiode signal with the same sine that was used for excitation and a corresponding cosine, then lowpass-filtering and averaging the two quadratures for a well-defined number of cycles (see Pyrpl API). From the two quadratures it is now possible to extract the magnitude and phase shift of our system in the probed frequency regime. In the figure below we see that for low frequencies the system follows without phase lag and for higher frequencies the phase increasingly lags as the signal magnitude decreases.\n System Transfer Function: Obtained by modulating the RF attenuation of the AOM driver with different frequencies and measuring the corresponding signal on the Photodiode. Do not get confused by the absolute Magnitude of the Gain values: A sinusoidal signal with 1mV amplitude going into the AOM driver does not correspond to a signal with 1mV on the photodiode. This is for example dependent on the offset (because of the slope) or the photodiode amplification. The relative numbers however give you insight in attenuation at higher frequencies and therefore System bandwidth.   It\u0026rsquo;s clear that this system doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any resonances and behaves quiet nicely in the displayed frequency regime. Therefore time-domain tuning methods for a servo like Ziegler-Nichols tuning can be effective and quick. But not every system behaves as nicely as this, so looking at the frequency-regime can be interesting and a way to improve your control, e.g. finding and filtering resonances makes it possible to increase overall gain without sacrificing stability.\nA closed loop After connecting the PI-controller which in our case is also done by the RedPitaya, we close the feedback loop. Now we select some proportional and integral constants such that the intensity is locked to a setpoint we choose. That means that the voltage on the photodetector will be the same as the chosen setpoint. How do we characterize the lock now? How do we know how stable the lock is? How do we know until which frequency noise is surpressed? We take the closed-loop transfer function T using the RedPitaya. With that we can calculate the open-loop transfer function H and look at the sensitivity S.\n Closed-loop transfer function T measured by the RedPitaya. For low frequencies the photodiode voltage follows the modulation well. For higher frequencies the gain of the system decreases. For higher proportional constant the transfer function does not decrease as much at higher frequencies.   After measuring T we can can calculate H. As mentioned in the introduction the criterion for instability is $\\left|H\\right|\u0026gt;1$ for a simultaneously phase lag close to 180°. Be careful that the unit in the figure is dB, which means that $\\left|H\\right|= 1 = 0 dB$. For low frequencies the transfer functino is ruled by the integrator\u0026rsquo;s characteristics. Which means high gain, but only a phase lag of 90°.\n Open-loop transfer function H.   The interesting regime is where the phase lag hits -180° which happens for ~40kHz for the orange curve and ~90kHz for the blue curve. But both sets of P\u0026amp;I-constants lead to stable behaviour, because the magnitude at that point is below 0dB.\nThe conclusion of this analysis shows that we could have gotten away with a higher proportional or integral constant and still have a stable system.\nSensitivity and noise surpression At this stage, we can finally analyse the level of noise suppression in the system.\n Noise spectra locked and unlocked.   We observe noise suppression for frequencies up to point where the system can react actively, which is about 30kHz.\nFurther Reading: Problems of Intensity stabilization Here we can already identify the first pitfall of intensity stabilization. The system, mainly the attenuator inside of the AOM driver, has a proportional gain that depends on the control voltage and is proportional to the slope . The highest gain (slope) is around a control voltage of 0.6V, and the proportional gain for values at 0.4V and 0.9V is very low. On the contrary, the PI-controller has fixed proportional and integral constants.\nIf you only want one specific laser power in your experiment, this does not bother you. You are using more or less one control voltage that gives you the desired laser power and then you tune the proportional constant of your PI-controller such that the system has the biggest bandwidth.\nBut imagine you would want to change this laser power now. By choosing a different setpoint/control voltage you would increase/decrease your proportional gain drastically end end up with an oscillating system or a system with very low bandwidth. If you would want your system to be stable for all control voltages, you would have to make sure that for the highest system proportional gain for a control voltage of 0.6V, you choose your PI-controller proportional gain such that your system is stable. Then you have the biggest bandwidth around a control voltage of 0.6V, but for all other control voltages you would have a smaller bandwidth. Imagine the worst case: You want high laser power for loading your laser dipole trap, and then reduce the trap depth for evaporative cooling by decreasing the laser power by a factor of 100. In the Figure this could for example mean, that you have a photodiode voltage of 9V for loading your trap and 90mV for evaporative cooling. In both cases the slope (proportional gain) is very small. If you want your laser power to be stable and not oscillating during the ramp-down (decrease of factor 100), you would have to accept a low bandwidth in both cases, for the loading and the evaporative cooling. One work-around could be that you sacrifice system-stability during the ramp-down for higher proportional gains in the loading and cooling stage. This however could lead to atom-loss due to parametric heating.\nAnother thing to keep in mind: usually your experimental approach is the following: I want 100mW during the first stage of the experiment and 10mW during the second stage of the experiment. For you to be able to choose a good regime of control voltage values, e.g. 0.5-0.7V, where the AOM Driver gain changes minimally, you have to be able to change either photodiode gain, pick-off ratio or initial laser power.\n","date":1524873600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609843797,"objectID":"f5c20c7a583b48bfbe9e476761c7d312","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/post/2018-feedback-for-amo-experimentalists/","publishdate":"2018-04-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018-feedback-for-amo-experimentalists/","section":"post","summary":"In this blog-post, we give a short introduction into feedback control for examples that are of interest to AMO experimentalists.","tags":["PID","feedback","laser control","intensity stabilization","tutorial"],"title":"Feedback for AMO experimentalists","type":"post"},{"authors":["Fred Jendrzejewski"],"categories":null,"content":"The Kondo effect is one of the hallmarks of condensed-matter physics. It describes the peculiar interactions between previously non-interacting Fermions, which are induced by a single spin impurity at a certain temperature. Despite (or maybe because of) its large interest as a benchmark for various theoretical frameworks, it is typically quite hard to find accessible introductions in the literature. Here, I will give a very naive interpretation of the Kondo effect and discuss its possible observation in ultracold atomic gases.\nA short history and a naive picture of the Kondo effect The Kondo model was originally proposed in 1964 to describe the appearance of a resistive minimum at a characteristic temperature $T_K$ in certain alloys (Citation: Kondo,\u0026#32; 1964) Kondo,\u0026#32; J. \u0026#32; (1964). \u0026#32;Resistance Minimum in Dilute Magnetic Alloys. Progress of Theoretical Physics,\u0026#32;32(1).\u0026#32;37–49. https://doi.org/10.1143/ptp.32.37 . In this model, a localized magnetic impurity of spin S = 1/2 is interacting with a metal host of non-interacting Fermions with spin s = 1/2. The interaction is described through an anti-ferromagnetic exchange term $H_I = J\\mathbf{s}(0)\\cdot \\mathbf{S}$ with $J \u0026gt; 0$. Because of the anti-ferrmagnetic interaction, we can identify the groundstate of the system as the singlet state, where impurity and electron of opposite spins.\nAt high temperatures, this coupling can be well described by the weak scattering of the Fermions on the impurity and the resistivity is decreasing as the temperature is lowered. Jun Kondo discovered in his seminal paper that the perturbative approach fails in the vicinity of the Kondo temperature $T_K$ as higher order perturbative terms diverge in this regime. Ever since, the Kondo model has inspired a large number of different theoretical approaches to explain the properties of this strongly correlated regime (Citation: Hewson,\u0026#32; 1993) Hewson,\u0026#32; A.\u0026#32; (1993). \u0026#32;The Kondo Problem to Heavy Fermions. \u0026#32; Cambridge University Press. https://doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511470752 , (Citation: Nozieres,\u0026#32; 1975) Nozieres,\u0026#32; P. \u0026#32; (1975). \u0026#32;The Kondo problem : Fancy mathematical techniques versus simple physical ideas.   or (Citation: N.A.)

They interact through an anti-ferromagnetic exchange interaction. a) For low temperatures, the interaction leads to the formation of a spin singlet between a Fermion and the impurity. The high energy cost of creating an excitation in the region of the impurity blocks it entirely from the dynamics of the Fermi sea. The Fermions can now be treated as a Fermi liquid with the impurity region removed. b) For intermediate temperatures the singlet gets deconfined and virtual excitations in the impurity region are allowed. As they involve the neighboring Fermions, they can lead to strong interactions between the previously non-interacting particles. These processes are typically only describable by non-perturbative techniques. c) For high temperatures, the interaction with the impurity is well described by perturbative scattering theory and the system is once again well described by a Fermi liquid.   As sketched in the figure, the following picture has emerged from these works. For low temperatures, $T\\ll T_K$, the impurity spin is confined in a many-body singlet ground state of extension $\\xi_K = \\frac{\\hbar v_F}{k_B T_K}$ , called the Kondo screening cloud. As the spin of the impurity is fully screened, the remaining electrons simply scatter on the region and the usual scattering can take place. For intermediate temperatures, the impurity is still bound in the singlet state, but virtual excitation due to Fermions hopping in the impurity region are allowed (see Fig. 1 b). The virtual excitation by one Fermion polarizes the impurity and this polarization is felt by the neighboring Fermions. Therefore, this process gives rise to interactions between the originally non-interacting Fermions. In the strong coupling regime, $T\\sim T_K$, these interactions are so strong that they cannot be treated perturbatively. For high temperatures, $T\\gg T_K$, the electrons are only weakly scattered by the impurity and the system is again well described by a Fermi liquid (see Fig. 1 c).\nSeveral decades after its first discovery in metals, the Kondo effect has been observed in a multitude of solid-state systems such as quantum dots (Citation: Kastner \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32; 1998) Kastner,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Goldhaber-Gordon,\u0026#32; D.,\u0026#32; Shtrikman,\u0026#32; H.,\u0026#32; Mahalu,\u0026#32; D.,\u0026#32; Abusch-Magder,\u0026#32; D.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Meirav,\u0026#32; U. \u0026#32; (1998). \u0026#32;Kondo effect in a single-electron transistor.

They have already proven to be a fantastic tool for the study of several simple impurity problems resulting in numerous intriguing quantum effects. In the simplest case, the impurities are static. They form a static disorder, which first leads to the well-known diffusion, but can eventually result in Anderson localization via the quantum interference between different diffusive paths (Citation: Anderson,\u0026#32; 1958) Anderson,\u0026#32; P. \u0026#32; (1958). \u0026#32;Absence of Diffusion in Certain Random Lattices.

The moving impurity is then dressed by a cloud of surrounding particles, leading to the formation of the polaron quasiparticles.

However they are typically formulated in the context of QCD or QED, whose only effect on me is profound sadness. Here, we will discuss a naive derivation of some of the concepts that might allow for the simulation of these dynamical gauge fields with ultracold atomic gases. We will start out the discussion, with a few basic principles of gauge transformations in quantum mechanics in Sec 2.\nIn Sec. 3 we will see that these gauge transformations, especially the U(1) transformations, have a deep relationship with the dynamics for non-relativistic particles in a magnetic and an electric field. Then we will get an effective Hamiltonian on a lattice.\nAfter this step, we can discuss a bit physics of dynamical gauge fields as they were originially introduced by Wilson in Sec. 4.\nAnd finally, we will discuss in Sec. 5 the formalism of Quantum Link models, which seems currently most promising for experimental set-ups. Actual experimental proposals will not be discussed here, as they typically involved the discretization of the Dirac equation.\nWe will exclusively discuss non-relativistic particles in 1D. This very simple system actually is so simplified, that it does not contain any interesting dynamics 1. However, it teaches us the most fundamental ingredients to design dynamical gauge fields on lattices. For further reading, I will guide the reader to the specialized literature, which will discuss such exciting problems like Schwinger pair production (Citation: Kasper \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32; 2017) Kasper,\u0026#32; V.,\u0026#32; Hebenstreit,\u0026#32; F.,\u0026#32; Jendrzejewski,\u0026#32; F.,\u0026#32; Oberthaler,\u0026#32; M.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Berges,\u0026#32; J. \u0026#32; (2017). \u0026#32;Implementing quantum electrodynamics with ultracold atomic systems.

Gauge transformations in quantum mechanics We will start out our discussion of dynamical gauge fields with a short review of gauge transformations in quantum mechanics. This is slightly unusual to the high-energy physicist, who will typcially start out with some Lagrangien and some symmetries as discussed for example in the PhD by Valentin Kasper. However, the AMO community used the gauge transformations very successfully to implement static gauge fields as very nicely reviewed in Ref. (Citation: Goldman \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32; 2014) Goldman,\u0026#32; N.,\u0026#32; Juzeliūnas,\u0026#32; G.,\u0026#32; Öhberg,\u0026#32; P.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Spielman,\u0026#32; I. \u0026#32; (2014). \u0026#32;Light-induced gauge fields for ultracold atoms. Reports on Progress in Physics,\u0026#32;77(12).\u0026#32;126401. https://doi.org/10.1088/0034-4885/77/12/126401  or the phantastic lecture by Jean Dalibard at the College de France 2.\nGiven a certain Hamiltonian, we can describe the time evolution of the wave function in terms of the Schrödinger equation:\n$$ i\\left|\\dot{\\psi}\\right\\rangle = \\hat{H}\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle $$ However, the choice of the reference frame is arbitrary and we could decide to look at the system in a different frame. Think about the rotating earth for example. We can try to understand it by rotating with it or by looking at it from the outside, where we see its rotation. Both are perfectly valid choices and should give the same predictions for observables. In quantum mechanics such a gauge transformation is expressed by an operator, which changes the wave function:\n$$ \\left|\\tilde{\\psi}\\right\\rangle = U\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle $$ We can now directly see that it should be unitary from the condition that the normalization of the wave function should not change : $$ \\left\\langle \\tilde{\\psi}|\\tilde{\\psi}\\right\\rangle \\equiv \\left\\langle \\psi|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\\\\n=\\left\\langle\\psi\\right|U^\\dagger U\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\\Rightarrow U^\\dagger U = 1 $$\nAny such unitary operators can also be written as a complex exponential with a hermitian generator $G = G^\\dagger$:\n$$\\begin{aligned} U \u0026amp;= e^{i \\hat{G}}\\\\\nUU^\\dagger \u0026amp;= e^{i \\hat{G}}e^{-i \\hat{G}^\\dagger} = 1\\end{aligned}$$ These generators will later play the role of local conservation laws.\nAs we would like to use such gauge transformations to engineer our Hamiltonians, we better also understand the connection between the Schrödinger equations in the different reference frames. In the standard frame, we can simply write: $$ i\\left|\\dot{\\psi}\\right\\rangle = \\hat{H}\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle $$ Let us now solve the Schrödinger equation for $\\tilde{\\psi}$, to see how see how we can connect the two frames. $$\\begin{aligned} \\label{eq:GaugeTransformation} i\\left|\\dot{\\tilde{\\psi}}\\right\\rangle \u0026amp;= \\hat{H}\\left|\\tilde{\\psi}\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\u0026amp;= Ui\\left|\\dot{\\psi}\\right\\rangle + i \\dot{U}\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\u0026amp;= \\left(UH + i\\dot{U}\\right)\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\u0026amp;= \\left(UH + i\\dot{U}\\right)U^\\dagger \\left|\\tilde{\\psi}\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\tilde{H} \u0026amp;= UHU^\\dagger + i\\dot{U}U^\\dagger \\end{aligned}$$\nSo as we change the reference frame, the Hamiltonian contains different terms. A typical example from the classical world is the Coriolis force experienced by a person on the earth.\nFinally, we would also like to understand how observables are transforming under a gauge transformation. We will always measure an observable given a certain state, so we should use:\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\langle A \\rangle \u0026amp;= \\left\\langle\\psi\\right|A\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\u0026amp;=\\left\\langle\\tilde{\\psi}\\right|UAU^\\dagger\\left|\\tilde{\\psi}\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\u0026amp;= \\left\\langle\\tilde{\\psi}\\right|\\tilde{A}\\left|\\tilde{\\psi}\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\tilde{A} \u0026amp;= UAU^\\dagger \\end{aligned}$$ Most of the time we are actually only interested in the time evolution of certain operators in the Heisenberg picture:\n$$i\\dot{A}_H = [H,A_H]$$\nA few calculations show that we obtain again as expected: $$i \\frac{d\\tilde{A}}{dt} =[\\tilde{H},\\tilde{A}]$$\nU(1) gauge transformations As a first important example for gauge transformation, we will study the multiplication of the wavefunction with a phase, i.e. U(1) gauge transformations. If the phase is constant in space and time, it leads to global number conservation. For a phase that is varying, the Hamiltonian emulates the motion of a charged particle in an EM field.\nThe U(1) transformation is then defined through:\n$$\\begin{aligned} U_1 \u0026amp;= e^{i\\varphi(\\hat{x},t)}\\\\\n\\left|\\tilde{\\psi}\\right\\rangle \u0026amp;= e^{i\\varphi(\\hat{x},t)}\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle \\end{aligned}$$\nGiven that we work in the lab with non-relativistic particles we use the normal single particle Hamiltonian:\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\hat{H}_0 \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m}+V(\\hat{x})\\\\\n[\\hat{x}_i,\\hat{p}_j] \u0026amp;= i\\delta_{ij} \\end{aligned}$$\nSo to understand how the Hamiltonian transforms, we can now analyze how $U_1$ transfroms $\\hat{p}$ and $\\hat{x}$. As $U$ is a function of $\\hat{x}$ and $t$ it commutes with $\\hat{x}$ and leaves it unchanged\n$$\\begin{aligned} U\\hat{x}U^\\dagger = \\hat{x}\\end{aligned}$$ For the momentum we have on the other hand: $$\\begin{aligned} U\\hat{p}U^\\dagger \u0026amp;\\approx (1+i\\varphi(\\hat{x},t)) \\hat{p}(1-i\\varphi(\\hat{x},t))\\\\\n\u0026amp;= \\hat{p} +i[\\varphi(\\hat{x},t),\\hat{p}]\\\\\n\u0026amp;= \\hat{p}-\\nabla_x \\varphi(\\hat{x},t) \\end{aligned}$$\nAnd for the time derivative we have:\n$$i \\dot{U}U^\\dagger = -\\dot{\\varphi}(\\hat{x},t)$$ In this frame the Hamiltonian has therefore the following form:\n$$ \\tag{1} \\label{Eq:HunderU1} H_1 = \\frac{\\left(p+\\nabla \\varphi(\\hat{x},t)\\right)^2}{2m}+V(\\hat{x})-\\dot{\\varphi}(\\hat{x},t) $$\nTo summarize:\n  If the externally imprinted phase of the wavefunction is changing over, the time derivative looks like a scalar potential or just some kind of energy shift.\n  If the gauge transformation has a position dependence, the derivative of the phase looks like a vector potential.\n  To get a better understanding of the relationship to electrodynamics we can just look at the classical equation of motion that comes out of this Hamiltonian. But before we get into this connection, let us finish the discussion here with the relationship between gauge symmetry and particle conservation, which the reader might skip in a first read.\n3. Non-relativistic motion in an electric and magnetic field We have seen that Eq. (\\ref{Eq:HunderU1}) looks a lot like a Hamiltonian of a charged electron that we know from EM, namely: $$\\begin{aligned} H_1 \u0026amp;= \\frac{(\\mathbf{p}+eA(\\mathbf{r},t))^2}{2m}+e\\phi(\\mathbf{r},t)\\end{aligned}$$ $eA(\\mathbf{r},t)$ is then the vectore potential and $e\\phi(\\mathbf{r},t)$ the scalar potential.\nLet us clarify this connection a bit more. In Hamiltonian mechanics we have to solve the equations of motion: $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{dp_i}{dt}\u0026amp;=-\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial r_i}\\\n\\frac{dr_i}{dt}\u0026amp;=\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_i}\\end{aligned}$$ We can now rewrite the Hamiltonian (\\ref{Eq:HunderU1}) as:\n$$\\begin{aligned} H_1 \u0026amp;= \\frac{(\\mathbf{p}+eA(\\mathbf{r},t))^2}{2m}+e\\phi(\\mathbf{r},t)\\\\\n\u0026amp;= \\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2 +2e\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})\\mathbf{p}+e^2\\mathbf{A}^2(\\mathbf{r})}{2m}+e\\phi(\\mathbf{r},t)\\\\\n\\text{with }\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r},t) \u0026amp;=\\frac{\\nabla \\varphi(\\mathbf{r},t)}{e}\\text{ and } \\phi(\\mathbf{r},t) =\\frac{ V(\\mathbf{r})-\\dot{\\varphi}(\\mathbf{r},t) }{e}\\end{aligned}$$\nWe actually find:\n$$\\begin{aligned} v_i \u0026amp;= \\frac{dr_i}{dt}= \\frac{p_i+eA_i(\\mathbf{r})}{m}\\\\\n\\frac{dp_i}{dt}\u0026amp;= -\\left[e\\frac{\\partial\\phi(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial r_i}+e\\sum_j \\frac{p_j}{m} \\frac{\\partial A_j(\\mathbf{r})}{\\partial r_i}+e^2\\sum_j \\frac{A_j(\\mathbf{r})}{m}\\frac{\\partial A_j(\\mathbf{r})}{\\partial r_i}\\right]\\\\\n\\frac{dp_i}{dt}\u0026amp;= -e\\left[\\frac{\\partial\\phi(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial r_i}+\\sum_j v_j \\frac{\\partial A_j(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial r_i}\\right]\\end{aligned}$$ For the time dynamics we finally obtain: $$\\begin{aligned} F_i \u0026amp;= m \\dot{v}_i = \\dot{p}_i+\\dot{A}_i(\\mathbf{r})\\\\\n\u0026amp;= -e\\left[\\frac{\\partial\\phi(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial r_i}+\\sum_j v_j \\frac{\\partial A_j(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial r_i}\\right]+e\\dot{A}_i(\\mathbf{r}) \\end{aligned}$$ In three dimensions we can now make the identification with the Lorentz force: $$\\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{F} \u0026amp;= e\\left(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\right)\\end{aligned}$$ And we obtain: $$\\label{Eq:DefElectricField}\\tag{2} \\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\phi(\\mathbf{r},t) + \\partial_t \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r},t) $$ and for the magnetic field $$\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$$\nSo we can obtain the equations of motion in a static electric or magnetic field by doing position and time-dependent U(1) transformations. 3 We have seen a first indication the a change in reference frame and electrodynamics are strongly linked. However, in this approach the external fields are static and not at all correlated with the dynamics of the matter field. To create a more complete picture of electrodynamics we should also include this dynamic degree of freedom. We will see later on that this is done conveniently on a lattice.\nDiscretization in 1D While we typically think about electromagnetism in continuous space, it is actually quite common to do most calculations on a lattice. As most AMO experiments and proposals work on a lattice, we will therefore just derive the formulation of electromagnetism on a lattice here 4. Again, if you know static synthetic gauge fields on a lattice, you might skip this section.\nThe Hamiltonian in the continuum limit was: $$\\begin{aligned} H = \\int dx ; \\psi^\\dagger(x) \\frac{\\left[p-eA(x)\\right]^2}{2m} \\psi(x) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\int dx ; \\left|\\left[\\partial_x + ie A(x) \\right]\\psi(x)\\right|^2; .\\end{aligned}$$ Now we discretize with lattice spacing $a$, $$\\begin{aligned} \\left[\\partial_x + ie A(x) \\right]\\psi(x) \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{a}\\left(\\psi_{n+1} - \\psi_n\\right) + ie A_n \\psi_n = \\frac{1}{a} \\left(\\psi_{n+1} - \\psi_n +iea A_n \\psi_n\\right) ; .\\end{aligned}$$ Thus we find with $A_n = A_n^\\dagger$ , $$\\begin{aligned} H \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2m a} \\sum_n \\left(\\psi_{n+1}^\\dagger - \\psi_n^\\dagger - iea \\psi_n^\\dagger A_n\\right) \\left(\\psi_{n+1} - \\psi_n +iea A_n \\psi_n\\right) \\equiv H_a ; .\\end{aligned}$$ Shifting the index of terms involving $\\psi_{n+1}^\\dagger \\rightarrow \\psi_n^\\dagger$, the summand becomes $$\\begin{aligned} \\psi_n^\\dagger \\left\\lbrace\\left(\\psi_n -\\psi_{n-1} +ie A_{n-1} \\psi_{n-1}\\right) - \\left(\\psi_{n+1} - \\psi_n +iea A_n \\psi_n\\right) -ie A_n \\left(\\psi_{n+1} - \\psi_n +iea A_n \\psi_n\\right)\\right\\rbrace ; .\\end{aligned}$$ Rearranging the terms, we find $$\\begin{aligned} 2ma H_a = \\sum_n \\left\\lbrace -\\psi_n^\\dagger \\left(1 + iea A_n\\right) \\psi_{n+1} + 2\\psi_n^\\dagger \\psi_n - \\psi_n^\\dagger \\left(1-ieaA_{n-1}\\right)\\psi_{n-1} +e^2 a^2 \\psi_n^\\dagger A_n^2 \\psi_n\\right\\rbrace \\end{aligned}$$ The lattice theory is not unique, in particular we can add any term $\\propto a$ because they will vanish in the continuum limit, where ($a\\rightarrow 0, N -\u0026gt; \\infty$ and $aN = const.$). For example a derivative term like $$\\begin{aligned} a\\sum_n \\psi_n^\\dagger A_n^2 \\cdot \\left(\\psi_{n+1} - \\psi_n\\right) \\approx \\int dx ; \\psi^\\dagger(x) A^2(x) \\cdot a \\partial_x \\psi(x)\\end{aligned}$$ should not contribute in the end. We thus consider the equivalent Hamiltonian $$\\begin{aligned} H_a \\simeq H_a + \\frac{1}{2ma} \\sum_n \\left(\\frac{a^2 e^2}{2}\\right) \\left\\lbrace\\psi_n^\\dagger A_n^2 \\left(\\psi_{n+1} - \\psi_n\\right) + \\left(\\psi_{n+1}^\\dagger - \\psi_n^\\dagger\\right)A_n^2 \\psi_n\\right\\rbrace ; ,\\end{aligned}$$ such that all terms involving $A^2$ combine to $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{ae^2}{2} \\left(\\psi_n^\\dagger A_n^2 \\psi_{n+1} + \\psi_{n+1}^\\dagger A_n^2 \\psi_n\\right)\\end{aligned}$$ Shifting everything to $\\psi_{n+1}^\\dagger$ as before, we arrive at $$\\begin{aligned} 2ma H_a = \u0026amp;-\\sum_n \\left\\lbrace \\psi_n^\\dagger \\left(1 + iea A_n -\\frac{1}{2} e^2 a^2 A_n^2\\right) \\psi_{n+1} + \\psi_n^\\dagger \\left(1-ieaA_{n-1} - \\frac{1}{2}e^2 a^2 A_{n-1}^2\\right)\\psi_{n-1} \\right\\rbrace \\nonumber\\\n\u0026amp;+ \\sum_n 2\\psi_n^\\dagger \\psi_n\\end{aligned}$$ Now we can define $U_n \\equiv \\exp \\left(iea A_n\\right) = 1 + iea A_n - \\frac{1}{2}e^2 a^2 A_n^2 + \\cdots$ and find the expected form $$\\begin{aligned} H_a \\simeq -\\frac{1}{2ma}\\sum_n \\psi_n^\\dagger \\left(U_n \\psi_{n+1} - 2\\psi_n + U_{n-1}^\\dagger \\psi_{n-1} \\right) ; ,\\end{aligned}$$ where we have again used that terms of order $\\mathcal{O}(a)$ don\u0026rsquo;t contribute to the continuum limit. For convenience, we may redefine $\\psi_n \\rightarrow \\sqrt{a} \\psi_n$, which makes the fields dimensionless and we end up with $$\\begin{aligned} H_a = -\\frac{1}{2ma^2}\\sum_n \\psi_n^\\dagger\\left(U_n \\psi_{n+1} + 2\\psi_n + U_{n+1}^\\dagger \\psi_{n-1}\\right); .\\end{aligned}$$\nWe will typically obtain on a lattice only the effective tunneling element, which we identify therefore as: $$\\begin{aligned} J \\equiv \\frac{1}{2m a_L^2}\\end{aligned}$$\nU(1) gauge transformations on a lattice For clarity, we will now reperform the U(1) gauge transformations on a lattice. This will greatly simplify the identification with an electric field etc. Skip it if you know it already.\nWe will employ the formalism of second quantization in the tight binding approximation:\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\hat{H} = - J \\sum_i \\left(a_i^\\dagger a_{i+1} +a_{i+1}^\\dagger a_i \\right) \\end{aligned}$$\nThe wave function is now formulated in terms of the field operator: $$\\begin{aligned} \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = \\sum_j \\hat{a}_j w_j(x) \\end{aligned}$$\nThe operators are defined to operate on the vacuum with the following commutation relationship: $$\\begin{aligned} a_j \\left|n_j\\right\\rangle = \\sqrt{n_j}\\left|n_j-1\\right\\rangle\\\\\na_j^\\dagger \\left|n_j\\right\\rangle = \\sqrt{n_j+1}\\left|n_j+1\\right\\rangle\\\\\n~[a_i,a_j^\\dagger] = \\delta_{ij} \\end{aligned}$$\nA transformation of the phase corresponds therefore too: $$\\begin{aligned} \\tilde{a}_j = e^{i\\varphi_j(t)}\\hat{a}_j\\end{aligned}$$\nNow we have to find the unitary operator that does the necessary transformation. We typically obtain the relation for the for small case $\\varphi_j$of smal $$\\begin{aligned} \\tilde{a}_j \u0026amp;= U_j a_j U_j^\\dagger\\\\\nU_j \u0026amp;= e^{i\\varphi_j(t)\\hat{G}_j}\\\\\n(1+i\\varphi_j)a_j \u0026amp;= (1+i\\varphi_j G_j)a_j (1-i\\varphi_j G_j)\\\\\na_j +i\\varphi_ja_j \u0026amp;= a_j + i\\varphi_j (Ga_j - a_jG)\\\\\na_j \u0026amp;= [G_j,a_j] \\end{aligned}$$\nThis last equation is solved by:\n$$\\hat{G}_j = -\\hat{N}_j =-a^\\dagger_j a_j$$\nAs each component commutes we can therefore write now:\n$$\\begin{aligned} U_1 = e^{i\\sum_j \\varphi_j(t) \\hat{N}_j} \\end{aligned}$$\nTherefore we obtain: $$\\begin{aligned} U_1HU_1^\\dagger \u0026amp;= -J\\sum_i \\left[a_i^\\dagger a_{i+1} e^{-i\\delta \\varphi_i} +a_{i+1}^\\dagger a_i e^{i\\delta \\varphi_i} \\right]\\\\\n\\delta \\varphi \u0026amp;= \\varphi_i-\\varphi_{i+1} \\end{aligned}$$\nFor the time dependence we have:\n$$\\begin{aligned} i\\dot{U}U^\\dagger = -\\sum_j \\hat{N}_j \\dot{\\varphi}_j \\end{aligned}$$\nSo the transformed Hamiltonian reads: $$ \\tag{3} \\label{Eq:LatticeWithMagField} \\tilde{H} = -J\\sum_i \\left[a_i^\\dagger a_{i+1} e^{-i\\delta \\varphi_i} +a_{i+1}^\\dagger a_i e^{i\\delta \\varphi_i} - \\dot{\\varphi}_i \\hat{N}_i\\right] $$ We can now identify the derivative of the phase with the vector potential and the time derivative with the scalar potential: $$\\begin{aligned} \\delta \\varphi_i \u0026amp;= eA_i a_L\\\n\\dot{\\varphi}_i \u0026amp;= e\\phi_i \\end{aligned}$$\nWe can now summarize these findings in the figure below. The identification with the magnetic field and the electric field are then again like in Eq.(\\ref{Eq:DefElectricField})5.\n Hopping in the lattice after a U(1) gauge transformation. At each hopping event to right, the particle acquires a phase $e\\ A_i\\ a$, which is proportional to the vector potential. Hopping to the left leads to the accumulation of the inverse phase $-e\\ A_ia$.   From the gauge symmetry to particle conservation We have seen that the equations of motion remain the same if the wave function is multiplied by a phase that is constant in space and time. We can see this directly from Eq. (\\ref{Eq:LatticeWithMagField}) with $\\varphi_j(t) = \\varphi$. So we obtain:\n$$\\begin{aligned} U_C \u0026amp;= e^{i\\varphi\\sum_j\\hat{N}_j }\\\\\n\\tilde{H} \u0026amp;= UHU^\\dagger = H\\\\\n\\Rightarrow UH \u0026amp;= HU\\\\\n\\Rightarrow [H,U] \u0026amp;= 0 \\end{aligned}$$\nIf the unitary operator commutes with the Hamiltonian, we also now that its generator $\\hat{N} = \\sum_j\\hat{N}_j$ commutes: $$\\begin{aligned} ~[H, N]=0 \\end{aligned}$$ And as the number generator does not depend explicitly on time we obtain from the Heisenberg equation that the total number of atoms is conserved.\n4. The Wilson approach to dynamical gauge fields Until now we seen that there is an intimate relation between the existance of electric and magnetic fields and $U(1)$ gauge transformations that depend on time and position. However, the gauge fields are not changing in any way as we are moving a charge. This is in direct constrast to electrodynamics where the motion of the charge implies directly the change of the electric field, see Figure below. This relationship is captured by Gauss' Law: $$\\tag{4} \\label{Eq:GaussLaw} \\mathbf{div} \\mathbf{E} = \\rho $$\nFurther the time evolution of the vector potential is not at all captured in the previous section. In electrodynamics we actually have to fulfill the relation: $$\\tag{5} \\label{Eq:MaxwellTime} \\partial_t \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{E} $$\n  Gauss law of electrodynamics. As the charge (blue) is displaced, the electric field is also modified. This perfect correlation between electric field and matter field, is one of the cornerstones of any realization of dynamical gauge fields in synthetic systems.   To implement these two constraint, we will have to modify the underlying Hamiltonian. So we look once again at the Hamiltonian (\\ref{Eq:LatticeWithMagField}) and rewrite it in a more suggestive way:\n$$\\label{eq:LatticeWithLink} \\tilde{H} = -J\\sum_i \\left[a_i^\\dagger L^*_i a_{i+1} +a_{i+1}^\\dagger L_i a_i - \\dot{\\varphi}_j \\hat{N}_j\\right] $$\nIf the $L_i$ was an operator it would actually have a very similiar structure to the Gauss law. As the particle hops from site to site it would change the operator $L_i$. We will call them in the following the link operators. In the next section, we adapt the Hamiltonian with dynamical links such that the system now fulfills Gauss' Law. Then we will also add an additional term to the Hamiltonian to obtain the appropiate time dynamics of ED afterwards.\nGauss law Eq. (\\ref{Eq:GaussLaw}) describes a local conservation law combining the matter field and the electric field. So we will be able to obtain such a relation by enforcing local gauge symmetry. To derive the local transformation laws, we will first perform a local gauge transformation of the matter field:\n$$\\begin{aligned} U =\u0026amp; e^{i\\varphi_j \\hat{N}_j}\\\\\n\\tilde{H} =\u0026amp;-J\\sum_{i\\neq j, j-1}\\left[a_i^\\dagger \\hat{L}^\\dagger_i a_{i+1} +a_{i+1}^\\dagger \\hat{L}_i a_i\\right]\\\\\n\u0026amp;- J \\left[a_{j-1}^\\dagger \\hat{L}^\\dagger_{j-1} a_{j} e^{i\\varphi_j} +a_{j}^\\dagger \\hat{L}_{j-1}a_{j-1} e^{-i \\varphi_j}\\right] \\nonumber\\\\\n\u0026amp;- J \\left[a_{j}^\\dagger \\hat{L}^\\dagger_{j} a_{j+1} e^{-i\\varphi_j} +a_{j+1}^\\dagger \\hat{L}_{j}a_{j} e^{i \\varphi_j} - \\dot{\\varphi}_{j}\\hat{N}_j\\right] \\end{aligned}$$\nSo we would obtain local gauge symmetry if we find a transformation of the form: $$\\begin{aligned} ~\\tilde{L}_j \u0026amp;= L_j e^{-i\\varphi_j}\\\\\n~\\tilde{L}_{j-1} \u0026amp;= L_{j-1} e^{i\\varphi_j} \\end{aligned}$$\nThis gauge transformation enforces the following conditions on the generator of the gauge transformation: $$\\begin{aligned} \\exp(i\\varphi G^L)L \\exp(-i\\varphi G^L) = \\exp(-i\\varphi)L \\end{aligned}$$\nLet me write it in an infinitisimal way: $$\\begin{aligned} \\exp(i\\varphi G^L)L \\exp(-i\\varphi G^L) \u0026amp;= (1+i\\varphi G^L)L (1-i\\varphi G^L) \\nonumber\\\\\n\u0026amp;= (L+i\\varphi G^L L) (1-i\\varphi G^L)\\nonumber\\\\\n\u0026amp;= (L+i\\varphi G^L L - i\\varphi L G^L)\\nonumber\\\\\n\u0026amp;= (1-i\\varphi )L\\nonumber \\end{aligned}$$\nWe end up with: $$\\tag{6}\\label{Eq:CommLinkOps} [L,G^L] = L $$\nSo we can actually now know that the Hamiltonian remains unchanged under a gauge transformation with the generator $$\\begin{aligned} G_j \u0026amp;= \\hat{N}_j + G^L_j - G^L_{j-1}\\\\\n\\tilde{H} =\u0026amp; -J\\sum_{i}\\left[a_i^\\dagger \\hat{L}^\\dagger_i a_{i+1} +a_{i+1}^\\dagger \\hat{L}_i a_i\\right]- J \\dot{\\varphi}_{j}\\hat{G}_j \\end{aligned}$$\nSo if we want to have gauge symmetry even for time dependent gauge transformations we have to fulfill $$\\begin{aligned} \\hat{G}_j\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = 0 \\end{aligned}$$\nAdditionally we can take a closer look at the structure of the generator, which can actuall rewrite as something similiar to Gauss' law: $$\\begin{aligned} \\hat{G}_j \u0026amp;= \\hat{N}_j + G^L_j - G^L_{j-1} \\\\\n\u0026amp;= \\hat{N}_j + (\\mathbf{div}G^L)_j\\\\\n\u0026amp;= \\hat{N}_j + \\frac{1}{e}(\\mathbf{div}E)_j \\end{aligned}$$\nSo we know that the electric field is basically the generator of the local gauge transformation of the link operators. Using Eq. (\\ref{Eq:CommLinkOps}) we can write down the commutation relation between link operator and electric field as: $$~[L_i,E_i] = eL_i$$ However, we do not know the value of the charge, nor the commutation relations of the link operators. We will obtain them from the time evolution of the gauge field.\nTime dynamics In analogy with classical mechanics we can introduce the Hamiltonian dynamics of the electric field via an $E^2$ term. So the full Hamiltonian reads now:\n$$ H = \\chi_L \\sum_i (G^L_i)^2 - J\\sum_i \\left[a_i^\\dagger L^\\dagger_i a_{i+1} +a_{i+1}^\\dagger \\hat{L}_i a_i \\right] $$ We now have to look at the time dynamics of the link operators. We obtain: $$i\\dot{L}_j = \\chi_L [(G^L_j)^2,L_j] - J\\sum_i \\left[a_i^\\dagger [L^\\dagger_i,L_j] a_{i+1} +a_{i+1}^\\dagger [\\hat{L}_i,L_j] a_i \\right]\\nonumber$$ Comparing to Eq. (\\ref{Eq:MaxwellTime}) we see that the commutators between the links should disappear. So we should enforce: $$\\begin{aligned} ~[L_i^\\dagger,L_j] \u0026amp;= 0\\\\\n~[L_i,L_j] \u0026amp;= 0\\\\\n~[L^\\dagger_i,L^\\dagger_j] \u0026amp;= 0 \\end{aligned}$$\nAt this stage we know that the link operators are unitary:\n$$\\begin{aligned} L_i^\\dagger L_i = L_i L_i^\\dagger \\end{aligned}$$\nSo in analogy with the classical case we will identify its phase with the vector potential as: $$\\begin{aligned} L_i = e^{ieA_i a_L} \\end{aligned}$$\nLet us now continue to look into the time evolution.\n$$\\begin{aligned} i\\dot{L}_j \u0026amp;= \\chi_L [(G^L_j)^2,L_j] \\\\\n\u0026amp;=\\chi_L \\left(G^L_j[G^L_j,L_j]+[G^L_j,L_j]G^L_j\\right)\\\\\n\u0026amp;= -\\chi_L \\left(G^L_jL_j+L_jG^L_j\\right) \\end{aligned}$$\nAnd in the classical limit we find now:\n$$-ea_L\\dot{A}_j = -2\\chi_L \\frac{E_j}{e}$$\nSo we know now that: $$\\begin{aligned} \\chi_L= \\frac{e^2 a_L}{2} \\end{aligned}$$\nOur Hamiltonian reads therefore: $$H = \\frac{a_L}{2} \\sum_i E_i^2 + \\frac{1}{2m a_L^2}\\sum_i \\left[a_i^\\dagger L^\\dagger_i a_{i+1} +a_{i+1}^\\dagger \\hat{L}_i a_i \\right]$$ End then we can identify : $$\\begin{aligned} \\chi_L= \\frac{e^2 a_L}{2}\\\nJ= \\frac{1}{2ma_L^2}\\end{aligned}$$\n5. The quantum link approach to dynamical gauge fields The previous approach relies on unitary link operatores, which are extremely hard to implement with ultracold atomic gases. The idea of QLM is relax the constraints on the link operators a bit, while keeping exactly the local gauge invariance. This is also the only formalism for which proposals of analog quantum simulation exist as discussed in Ref. (Citation: Zohar \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32; 2016) Zohar,\u0026#32; E.,\u0026#32; Cirac,\u0026#32; J.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Reznik,\u0026#32; B. \u0026#32; (2016). \u0026#32;Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories using ultracold atoms in optical lattices.

The discussion on the Gauss' law remains the same as in the previous section, so we would like to have:\n$$\\tag{7}\\label{eq:CommutRelLinks} [L_i,G^L_i] = L_i ~~[L^\\dagger_i,G^L_i] = -L^\\dagger_i $$\nUsing spins as links A nice way out of the problems with finding a unitary link operator was suggested by [@Chandrasekharan1997; @Horn1981; @Orland1990]. Actually, we can decompose the link into its real and imaginary part: $$\\label{Eq:LatticeWithLink} L_i = e^{ieA_i a_L} =\\cos(eA_i a_L) + i\\sin(eA_i a_L) $$ Instead of using a cosine function we now simply set the real and imaginary part as operators: $$\\begin{aligned} \\hat{L}_i = \\hat{C}_i + i\\hat{S}_i\\\n\\hat{L}_i^\\dagger = \\hat{C}_i - i\\hat{S}_i \\end{aligned}$$\nWe can now plug in these definitions into equation (\\ref{eq:CommutRelLinks}) and obtain: $$\\begin{aligned} ~[C+iS, G]\u0026amp;= C + iS \\\\\n~[C,G] + i [S,G] \u0026amp;= C + iS \\\\\n~[C,G] \u0026amp;= iS \\label{Eq:CommSpinLinks} \\end{aligned}$$\nIn a similiar fashion we have:\n$$\\begin{aligned} ~[C-iS, G]\u0026amp;= -(C - iS)\\\\\n~[C,G] - i [S,G] \u0026amp;= iS -C\\\\\n~[G,S] \u0026amp;= iC \\end{aligned}$$\nThe last line sets the commutation relationship of the links. These can be directly identified with the commutation relationships of a spin. So we directly find that we will be able to represent the link operator by composition of spins:\n$$\\begin{aligned} C = J_x\\\\\nS = J_y\\\\\nG = -J_z \\end{aligned}$$\nAnd we can also write down the link operator as: $$\\begin{aligned} L \u0026amp;= J_x + iJ_y = J_+\\\\\nL^\\dagger \u0026amp;=J_x - iJ_y = J_- \\end{aligned}$$\nLet us write down explicitly once more the commutation relationships that we have in the QLM: $$ [L_i, G_i^L]=[J_+, -J_z] =J_+\\label{eq:CommLinkQLM}\\tag{8} $$\nSo while we keep local gauge invariance, we have now non-commutating link operators. This means that we implement properly the Gauss' law. However, the time evolution will only correspond in certain limits to the time evolution of QED. As reminder each operator acts in the following way on an eigenstate:\n$$\\begin{aligned} J^2 \\left|m,\\ell\\right\\rangle \u0026amp;= \\ell(\\ell+1)\\left|m,\\ell\\right\\rangle\\\\\nJ_z \\left|m,\\ell\\right\\rangle \u0026amp;= m\\left|m,\\ell\\right\\rangle\\\\\nJ_+\\left|m,\\ell\\right\\rangle \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\ell(\\ell+1)-m(m+1)}\\left|m+1,\\ell\\right\\rangle\\\\\nJ_-\\left|m,\\ell\\right\\rangle \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\ell(\\ell+1)-m(m-1)}\\left|m-1,\\ell\\right\\rangle \\end{aligned}$$\nIdentification with QED We can once again write down our microscopic Hamiltonian: $$H_{QL} = \\chi_L \\sum_i (J_z^i)^2-J\\sum_i \\left[a_i^\\dagger \\hat{J}^+_i a_{i+1} +a_{i+1}^\\dagger \\hat{J}^-_i a_i \\right]$$ We would now like to make the connection to QED. For that we need the commutators in equation \\ref{eq:CommLinkQLM} to become negligable. We actually know that this will typically happen in the limit of large occupation numbers for the spin. In this case we can write (PhD by Christian Gross): $$\\begin{aligned} \\hat{J}_x \u0026amp;\\approx \\ell \\cos(\\hat{\\varphi})~~\\hat{J}_y \\approx \\ell \\sin(\\hat{\\varphi})\\\n\\Rightarrow J_+ \u0026amp;\\approx \\ell e^{i\\hat{\\varphi}}~~ J_- \\approx \\ell e^{-i\\hat{\\varphi}}\\end{aligned}$$ So we definitely want to take the prefactor $\\ell$ out of hopping element and define: $$\\begin{aligned} L_i^\\dagger = \\frac{J_i^+}{\\ell}~~L_i = \\frac{J_i^-}{\\ell}\\end{aligned}$$ So the Hamiltonian should now be written as: $$H_{QL} = \\chi_L \\sum_i (J_z^i)^2+\\frac{\\ell}{m^* a_L^2}\\sum_i \\left[a_i^\\dagger \\hat{L}^\\dagger_i a_{i+1} +a_{i+1}^\\dagger \\hat{L}_i a_i \\right]$$\nIn the next step, we have to verify that the equations of motion are the appropiate ones. We obtain:\n$$\\begin{aligned} i\\dot{J}^+_i \u0026amp;= \\chi_L [(J_z^i)^2, J_i^+]-Ja_{i+1}^\\dagger a_i [J_i^-,J_i^+]\\\\\n\u0026amp;=-\\chi_L (J_i^zJ_i^++J_i^+J_z^i)+2Ja_{i+1}^\\dagger a_i J^z_i \\end{aligned}$$\nIn the classical limit we obtain now:\n$$\\begin{aligned} -\\ell e\\dot{A}_i a_L= \\left(\\frac{-2\\chi_L \\ell}{e}+2Ja_{i+1}^\\dagger a_i\\right)E_i\\\\\n\\dot{A}_i= \\left(\\frac{2\\chi_L }{e^2a_L}-\\frac{2Ja_{i+1}^\\dagger a_i}{e\\ell a_L}\\right)E_i \\end{aligned}$$\nSo the coherence could now be driving the dynamics as in the usual spin changing collision. However, let us simply assume that it is in the order of one. Then obtain the condition for finding the QED limit that: $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{2\\chi_L }{e^2a_L}\u0026amp;\\gg\\frac{2J}{e\\ell a_L}\\\n\\ell\u0026amp;\\gg\\frac{Je}{\\chi_L}\\end{aligned}$$ If we have this condition we can actually write down once again the previous equation of motion, where we found that: $$\\begin{aligned} \\chi_L=\\frac{e^2}{2a_L}\\end{aligned}$$\nFrom theory towards experiments The theoretical concepts of dynamical gauge fields in ultracold atomic systems have been relatively well established in the last few years and studied in several theory groups. However, the experimental efforts are still way behind the theoretical framework. The gap is actually so strong that only a single experiment has been performed with ultracold ions (Citation: Martinez \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32; 2016) Martinez,\u0026#32; E.,\u0026#32; Muschik,\u0026#32; C.,\u0026#32; Schindler,\u0026#32; P.,\u0026#32; Nigg,\u0026#32; D.,\u0026#32; Erhard,\u0026#32; A.,\u0026#32; Heyl,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Hauke,\u0026#32; P.,\u0026#32; Dalmonte,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Monz,\u0026#32; T.,\u0026#32; Zoller,\u0026#32; P.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Blatt,\u0026#32; R. \u0026#32; (2016). \u0026#32;Real-time dynamics of lattice gauge theories with a few-qubit quantum computer.

The local gauge symmetry is realized in an optical superlattice, using heteronuclear boson-fermion spin-changing interactions which preserve the total spin in every local collision. We consider a large number of bosons residing in the coherent state of a Bose-Einstein condensate on each link between the fermion lattice sites, such that the behavior of lattice QED in the continuum limit can be recovered. The discussion about the range of possible experimental parameters builds, in particular, upon experiences with related setups of fermions interacting with coherent samples of bosonic atoms. We determine the atomic system's parameters required for the description of fundamental QED processes, such as Schwinger pair production and string breaking.

We also measured the size of the hysteresis loops in our superfluid ring as a function of temperature, enabling us to extract the critical velocity. The measured critical velocity is found to depend strongly on temperature, approaching the zero-temperature mean-field solution as the temperature is decreased. This indicates that an appropriate definition of critical velocity must incorporate the role of thermal fluctuations, something not explicitly contained in traditional theories.","tags":["jqi","atomtronics","superfluid","ultracold"],"title":"Temperature induced decay of persistent currents in superfluid ultracold gas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Mil"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1475280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609656932,"objectID":"98ee13f6a7776cbee81ce357096dcf60","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/thesis/mil-2016/","publishdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis/mil-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"This thesis presents the design and implementation of a high resolution objective lens for imaging ultracold atomic clouds of sodium and lithium in the NaLi experiment.

Hysteresis is widely used in electronic circuits-it is routinely observed in superconducting circuits and is essential in radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference devices. Furthermore, it is as fundamental to superfluidity (and superconductivity) as quantized persistent currents, critical velocity and Josephson effects. Nevertheless, despite multiple theoretical predictions, hysteresis has not been previously observed in any superfluid, atomic-gas Bose-Einstein condensate. Here we directly detect hysteresis between quantized circulation states in an atomtronic circuit formed from a ring of superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate obstructed by a rotating weak link (a region of low atomic density). This contrasts with previous experiments on superfluid liquid helium where hysteresis was observed directly in systems in which the quantization of flow could not be observed, and indirectly in systems that showed quantized flow. Our techniques allow us to tune the size of the hysteresis loop and to consider the fundamental excitations that accompany hysteresis. The results suggest that the relevant excitations involved in hysteresis are vortices, and indicate that dissipation has an important role in the dynamics. Controlled hysteresis in atomtronic circuits may prove to be a crucial feature for the development of practical devices, just as it has in electronic circuits such as memories, digital noise filters (for example Schmitt triggers) and magnetometers (for example superconducting quantum interference devices).","tags":["jqi","hysteresis","superfluid","ultracold"],"title":"Hysteresis in a quantized superfluid 'atomtronic' circuit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fred Jendrzejewski","Kilian Müller","Jeremie Richard","Aditya Date","Thomas Plisson","Philippe Bouyer","Alain Aspect","Vincent Josse"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609328303,"objectID":"7c93faeedcaa43c98e8aa2d0be671818","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/jendrzejewski-2012/","publishdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jendrzejewski-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"We report on the direct observation of coherent backscattering (CBS) of ultracold atoms in a quasi-two- dimensional configuration.
