Labscript devices as used at SynQS. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/fretchen/synqs_devices).

Devices include:

- Mako G 030-B camera. It uses Pymba as a backbone. Although this labscript code is written and tested just for Mako G030-B camera, it should work for many other camera models too (with little to zero modification), because Pymba works for them.
- SynthHDDevice. It programs the SynthHD.
- YunTemp. Integrating our temperature control directly in BLACS.
- CustomArduinoDevice. Control of the Arno tower as described in the PhD of Arno Trautmann.

The full documentation, generated by Sphinx, can be found on the associated Github page:
